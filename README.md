# Course-Organization-App

I was told to that is you don't know what to create, create things that you can and want to use.
It got me thinking and as such I decided to create something that I would like to have available during school semesters.
I am a hyper organized person and a lot of times I've wonder how great it would be to have all the information about, 
what Utech call modules (what other universities may refer to as courses), were in one place and as such I create
something that would do just that.

## Tech Stack
Frontend: React + vue
Backend: Java Spring 
Database: mysql

I am new to the world of react and I thought this was a great opportunity to learn it in a trial and error method,
it was a fun experience. I used the spring framework in java to write a rest API and while I am comfortable with java
this was also a trial and error with the framework
